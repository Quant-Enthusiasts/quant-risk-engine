# Quant Risk Engine

## Overview
Quant Risk Engine is an open-source project for advanced risk modeling and derivative pricing. It is designed for contributors with strong programming skills and knowledge of quantitative finance.

## Features
- Monte Carlo simulations for portfolio and derivative pricing.
- Risk metrics including Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR (CVaR).
- Implementation of stochastic models such as GBM and Heston.
- Extendable modules for new risk calculations.

## Roadmap
1. Add Monte Carlo simulation templates.
2. Implement basic risk metrics and stress tests.
3. Provide example derivative pricing modules.
4. Allow community contributions for new models and optimizations.

## Getting Started
1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Follow the instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
3. Begin by implementing modules, risk metrics, or simulation templates.

## Vision
Develop a high-quality, community-maintained engine for risk analysis and derivative pricing that links theory with practical computation.
